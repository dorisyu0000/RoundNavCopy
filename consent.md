You have been invited to take part in a research study to learn more about the cognitive mechanisms underlying memory, value-based learning, and decision-making. This study will be conducted by Marcelo Mattar, FAS - Psychology, Arts & Science, New York University

<!-- ##### Study procedures -->

If you agree to be in this study, you  will be presented repeatedly with images and written words on your computer screen and asked to memorize them or to make decisions, responding using key presses or mouse clicks. 

The amount of time to complete the study may vary between 5-90 minutes, depending on the experimental condition. A more precise time estimate is provided on the Prolific flyer. There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research beyond those of everyday life.

For your participation, you will receive the base payment advertised on the Prolific flyer. You may additionally receive a bonus payment based on the decisions you make in the experiment (the maximum bonus is also given on the Prolific flyer). The base payment and bonus are determined such that a median (i.e., typical) wage is US$12 per hour.

If for any reason you do not complete the study (e.g. technical difficulties, or a desire to stop), you will receive a pro-rated payment based on the ammount of the experiment that you completed. Importantly, in the event that you do not finish the study, we will only be able to provide partial compensation if you send a message through Prolific.

Although you will receive no direct benefits, this research may help the investigator understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying memory, value-based learning, and decision-making.

We will collect your prolific IDs for the purpose of assigning performance-dependent bonuses. However, this information will never be publicly shared. 

Anonymized data with identifying information removed may be used in future research, shared with other researchers, or placed in a data repository without your additional consent.

Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without penalty. You have the right to skip or not answer any questions you prefer not to answer (with the exception of quizzes to ensure the comprehension of instructions).

If there is anything about the study or your participation that is unclear or that you do not understand, if you have questions or wish to report a research-related problem, you may contact Marcelo Mattar at <mm13100@nyu.edu>; (267) 340-7645; 6 Washington Place, Room 863A New York, NY 10003.
